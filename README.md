OPERATIONS

Business operations encompass various activities necessary for the daily operation and success of an organization. Different businesses have unique operational needs, with core functions like payroll, order management, and marketing common across most organizations. Some operations, such as IT departments or warehouses, may not be essential for all businesses.
 
Data plays a crucial role in quantifying and optimizing operations, such as in human resources (HR) functions. Various data points are used to make decisions, track progress, and support functions like recruitment and evaluation. Data is generated in abundance throughout these processes, created by applicants, evaluators, and supporting systems. Operations teams, like sales teams reporting to headquarters, rely on data to make informed decisions and enable systems to run smoothly. Many data functions within operations are automated, such as inventory systems generating replenishment orders or email notifications for unfinished tasks. Ultimately, data is essential for driving efficiency, making informed decisions, and supporting the overall functioning of operations.

STRATEGY

Every organization, whether explicitly stated or not, has a strategy in place. This involves creating a plan to support goals and objectives by identifying challenges and proposing solutions. Strategy can be implemented at different levels within an organization, such as department or division levels, with the goal of understanding the path forward and developing a plan to achieve it. Successful strategy implementation is dependent on operational support to achieve its objectives, with data-driven strategies and operational excellence working hand in hand. The process of creating a strategy involves analyzing the environment, drawing conclusions, and developing a plan guided by principles derived from various factors.

The construction of a plan should not rely solely on data and information but also incorporate the perspectives and beliefs of experienced individuals. The right balance between data and non-data sources is crucial for successful outcomes. Strategy development should be considered an ongoing process, with periodic revisions guided by new data and insights. In the modern era, organizations must be able to quickly adapt to changing environmental conditions, with data playing a key role in their response system.

DECISION MAKING

Without even creating a single unit of raw data, there’s a universe of existing data and information at our fingertips. In addition, increasing numbers of easy-to-use analysis capabilities and tools are democratizing access to insight.

Consumer search engines like Google and Bing have changed how people make decisions, making them more informed. This has impacted the healthcare industry, with patients researching their symptoms and causes. While it has reduced unnecessary clinic visits, incorrect information can be a challenge for doctors. Within organizations, access to data has led to quicker and better decisions, allowing executives to understand their strengths and weaknesses in real-time, rather than waiting until the end of the fiscal quarter.

While there’s little surprise that data-driven decision-making is a fundamental business competency, it all hinges on decision-makers getting access to quality data at the right time. Abundant and out-of-date data are not synonymous with data value. Bad data may be worse than no data. Bad data processed into information and then used as the basis for decisions will result in failure. The outcome of decisions based on bad data could range from a minor mistake to job termination right up to the closing of the business.![image](https://github.com/NdiiLe/Data-Governance-week-2/assets/131252498/cc681758-536d-4de3-82c8-a75640fb3f2c)


MEASURING

Organizations constantly measure data to build a business picture. The phrase "what gets measured gets managed" is relevant, although not everything can be easily measured. Leaders need timely information derived from data, emphasizing the importance of measurement in decision-making processes within organizations.

Data measurements can be quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative data is most often described in numerical terms, whereas qualitative data is descriptive and expressed in terms of language.

One way to differentiate between quantitative and qualitative data is by looking at how someone describes a journey in a plane. One person may focus on specific measurements like altitude and speed, while another may focus on subjective experiences like comfort and food quality. Both types of data can be meaningful depending on the audience.

The type of information desired directly correlates to the measurement approach. This is going to inform your choices of at least what, when, where, and how data is captured. A general rule is only to capture and measure what matters. Some may argue that capturing data now to measure later has value even if there isn’t a good case yet. I can buy that but be careful with your limited resources and the potential costs.

William Bruce Cameron's quote suggests that not everything valuable can be measured, and not everything measurable is valuable. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing the limitations of data analysis.

MONITORING

Monitoring is a continuous process of collecting and evaluating the performance of a project, process, or system. Results are compared against existing values or desired targets to ensure expectations are being met. This ongoing monitoring helps ensure continuity, stability, and reliability in various activities and operations.

Involved in monitoring is the data produced by the thing being evaluated. It’s also the data that is produced as a product of monitoring. For example, the deviation from the expected result.

Monitoring involves converting data into insights through reports, real-time systems, and software dashboards. It helps in making decisions by providing information on various aspects like power levels in devices, employee activities, and predictive maintenance. Data measurement and monitoring are interconnected, with data serving as a binding element for business functions. Different teams within an organization handle data measurement, monitoring, and actions based on the data. Data monitoring also involves assessing the quality of data to ensure it is suitable for its intended purpose. This process requires establishing metrics for data quality, such as completeness and accuracy, and continuously evaluating and improving data quality over time. Overall, data monitoring is crucial for effective decision-making and ensuring the reliability of data-driven processes within an organization.

By continuously monitoring the quality of the data in your organization, opportunities and issues may be revealed in a timely manner. Then, if deemed appropriate, actions can be prioritized.

INSIGHT MANAGEMENT

Data forms the building blocks of many business functions. In support of decision-making — arguably its most important value — data is the source for almost all insight. As a basic definition, business insight is sometimes referred to as information that can make a difference.

It’s not enough to simply collect lots of data and expect that insight will suddenly emerge. There must be an attendant management process. Thus, insight management means ensuring that data and information are capable of delivering insight.

Insight management involves analyzing data to determine what information is valuable to an organization. Analysts must understand the organization's information needs and how data flows across different areas. Analytics are then applied to interpret data and draw conclusions. Communication of findings is crucial, with different audiences requiring different methods of delivery. Success is measured by the ability of recipients to make decisions aligned with organizational goals based on the insights provided.

For an insight to be most valuable, it must be the right information, at the right time, in the right format, for the right people. But this in general is no simple task.

REPORTING

Reports play a crucial role in data and information management within organizations. They are essential for creating, delivering, receiving, and acting on important information. The content of a report can vary from summarized to detailed, providing structured data and information. Visual aids, such as charts, are often included to help interpret data more easily. Reports also often include a discussion of findings and may offer recommendations. In today's business environment, data storytelling is becoming increasingly important as a required business skill. Reports are considered the backbone of every organization, highlighting their importance in decision-making processes.

Reports are typically online or physical presentations of data and information on some aspect of an organization. For example, a written and printed report may show all the sales of a particular product or service during a specific period. Sometimes a report is given verbally in person or via a live or recorded video. Whatever the format — and that’s less important today as long as it achieves its objective — a report is developed for a particular audience with a specific purpose.

With so many uses of data and information, the purpose of reporting is largely about improved decision-making. With the right information, in the right format, at the right time, business leaders are empowered to make better decisions, solve problems, and communicate plans and policies.

While reports do empower leaders and give them more tools, they don’t guarantee the right decisions. Knowing something is not the equivalent of making the right choices at the right time.

Other Roles for Data
While we’ve gone over a number of the most visible uses of data in organizations today, it was not the intent to list every conceivable way that data is used. That said, here’s a short list of some other important areas that we should not omit.
• Artificial intelligence (AI):  Data is considered the fuel of AI. It requires a high volume of good data. With huge quantities of quality data, the outcomes of AI improve. It’s from the data that AI learns patterns, identifies relationships, and determines probabilities. In addition, AI is being used to improve the quality and use of data in organizations. 
• Problem-solving:  Acknowledging the close association with decision-making, it’s worth calling out problem-solving as a distinctive use of data. Data plays a role in how a problem is defined, determining what solutions are available, evaluating which solution to use, and measuring the success or failure of the solution that is chosen and applied.
• Data reuse:  While we collect and use data for a specific primary purpose, data is often reused for entirely different reasons. Data that has been collected, used, and stored can be retrieved and used by a different team at another time - assuming they have permission, including access and legal rights (notable controls within data governance). For example, the sales team in an organization will collect your name and address in order to fulfill an order. Later, that same data set may be used by the marketing team to create awareness about other products and services. These are two different teams with different goals using the same data. Data reuse can be considered a positive given that it reduces data collection duplication and increases the value of data to an organization, but it must be managed with care so that it doesn’t break any data use rules. (Note: High-value shared data sets are called master data, and in data governance, they are subject to master data management.)

	• Data democratization is the ability for team members to access data without relying on specialists.
	• As organizations grow, data sets become siloed, hindering business efficiencies and increasing inconsistencies.
	• Data governance helps eliminate these silos and makes data discoverable whenever it adds value.
	• Data catalogs are essential for data governance.
	• However, most organizations lack a universal search engine to locate and serve up data.
	• Business leaders spend 70% of their time trying to find data and 30% analyzing it.
	• Accessing data from the internet is often easier than using internal search systems.
	• Knowledge of available data is essential for better informed decision-making, compliance, lower costs, improved data analytics, higher-performing systems, more efficient operations, and reducing data inconsistencies.
	• The vendor community can help build internal search capabilities and with investment and effort, finding data and information in the enterprise is possible.

Data Catalogs:

	• To help your organization find data, consider creating an enterprise search engine or an enterprise data catalog.
	• These tools offer advantages such as finding useful data, understanding data, and making data more useful.
	• They help users identify and locate relevant data, answer questions about data purpose and usage, and create visibility and access to information.
	• When used correctly, a data catalog provides an enterprise view of all data, enabling insights and enhancing data governance.
	• A data catalog is more than just a list of data sets; it contains metadata about the data, which can be curated manually or automated processes, with AI playing a growing role in this process.
	• A data catalog can contain technical, business, and operational metadata.
	• Technical metadata includes information about the design of a data set, business metadata includes organizational data, and operational metadata includes data access, users, and backups.
	• A well-managed data catalog can help organizations identify data gaps, reduce duplication, increase operational efficiencies, understand data quality, manage compliance, and enjoy cost savings from improved operations.

Figure 10 illustrates the basic building blocks of a data catalog.



Case Study: Unlocking Data Silos with a Data Catalog:
Data Analytics:

Data can hold significant business value, but it requires a specialized approach to unlock its potential.
Data analytics involves collecting, organizing, storing, and analyzing data to extract valuable insights.
It can be used for decision-making, marketing campaigns, understanding competition, designing innovative products, improving customer service, and improving operations.
Data analytics has grown significantly in recent years due to the rise of big data, data science as a business competency, and the introduction of AI tools.
Organizations must be prepared to govern their data analytics capabilities, including policies, experienced talent, and a suite of modern software tools, to unlock the power of data and discover valuable insights.

Data Monetization:

Data valuation is a crucial process for organizations to accurately capture their financials and understand the importance and role of each asset.
It helps organizations appreciate the value of specific data sets, which can provide opportunities for business growth and operational excellence.
Data monetization, where data provides an economic benefit, is a more advanced approach.
Data valuation is generally recommended in larger enterprises but is also required for advanced data monetization such as selling or licensing data.
There are various methods to determine data valuation, including cost value, market value, economic value, and with-and-without methods.
Each method has its limitations and is subjective, but they all contribute to the overall value of data.
To optimize data monetization, organizations must be intentional in managing data assets, have a plan for utilization, and measure return on investment.
For optimal data monetization, organizations must manage high-value data with the same level of rigor as their most important tangible assets.

Data-Driven Decision Making:

Data-driven decision-making (DDDM) is the process of using data to drive business decisions.
While basic DDDM can be practiced by most team members, organizations need a data culture and specific skills and tools.
Leadership support, data appreciation and analytics, and data-security and data-use policies are essential for achieving high performance.
Executives who demonstrate DDDM serve as role models for the entire enterprise.
Ensuring the right people can use the right data at the right time is crucial for data governance.
The six-step process to data-driven decision-making involves defining objectives, identifying data, preparing the data, analyzing the data, determining the findings, and taking action.
Understanding the objectives and their alignment with organizational goals helps scope work and define metrics.
Engaging with stakeholders and consulting with data stewards and owners can help gather necessary data.
Preparing the data involves using a useful analytics tool, such as an ETL architecture, and presenting relevant representations like graphs and charts.
Identifying the findings involves asking questions about the data, which can be aided by training or experience.
Taking action is the final step, as data-driven decision-making is all about the decisions that result in actions.
It is common to iterate through some steps to get to a good place for analysis.
Data-driven decision-making can be a game-changer for any organization, as it leads to better decisions, increased team empowerment, and greater collaboration between business units.

Developing a Data Strategy for Improved Results:

The course emphasizes the importance of deliberate actions to maximize data's potential.
However, many organizations take a passive approach to data management, often reactive and reactive.
Reasons for not taking a proactive approach include cost, complexity, and lack of understanding of data management and governance.
To effectively manage data as a high-value asset, a data strategy is essential, as it helps businesses recognize its potential.

Why does every organization need a data strategy?

A strategy is a set of guiding principles that inform decision-making to achieve a desired outcome.
It is crucial for businesses to have clear visions and missions, as without a current strategy, conflicts can arise.
Many organizations lack a well-communicated strategy, which can be difficult to create and execute.
However, organizations with a clear strategy typically execute with efficiency, have higher profits, grow larger, and more frequently hit their success targets.

Creating a Data Stratey:

Data maturity refers to an organization's existing data usage and quality, with organizations prioritizing it as a strategic asset.
Prioritization can be categorized into defense and offense, with defense focusing on data security and quality, and offense using data for insight management and market-facing initiatives.
Depending on the industry and size, organizations should follow a suitable data strategy, ensuring a balance between complexity for small businesses and sophistication for large, complex, and highly regulated organizations.
A data strategy should address five areas of data requirements: identifying, storing, provision, process, and governing.
It should align with the business strategy, ensuring it supports and advances the organization's larger goals.
Identifying roles and responsibilities is crucial, as it requires specific actions from team members.
Data strategy should be documented, focusing on data consumers, data scientists, analysts, data stewards, and management.
Data architecture refers to the processes, systems, and applications that support working with data, including storage needs, analysis tools, and data catalogs.
A data strategy should support scalability and flexibility as needs change.
Data management encompasses activities that manage the full lifecycle of data, including data security, privacy, quality, metadata, integration, master data management, and analytics.
Data architecture is often the driver of choosing and designing data management processes and systems.
Data governance sets rules for data use, while data management ensures these rules are followed, such as confidentiality classifications.
Data management involves processes, tools, and staff to enforce these rules.

Managing and Monitoring Your Data Strategy:

Successfully designing, creating, and implementing a data strategy in an organization can significantly enhance its ability to leverage data and increase performance.
However, success depends on various factors and requires buy-in, a roadmap, and execution.
Data governance and management functions must also be in place.
All strategies must be open to periodic modification due to evolving customer expectations, organizational needs, and the economy.
Timely strategic corrections reflect good leadership.
It is essential to regularly review and modify data strategies, including data strategy, to ensure they align with the organization's needs and goals.
This is a core characteristic of an agile organization in the 21st century.
