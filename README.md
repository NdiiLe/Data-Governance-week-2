OPERATIONS

Business operations encompass various activities necessary for the daily operation and success of an organization. Different businesses have unique operational needs, with core functions like payroll, order management, and marketing common across most organizations. Some operations, such as IT departments or warehouses, may not be essential for all businesses.
 
Data plays a crucial role in quantifying and optimizing operations, such as in human resources (HR) functions. Various data points are used to make decisions, track progress, and support functions like recruitment and evaluation. Data is generated in abundance throughout these processes, created by applicants, evaluators, and supporting systems. Operations teams, like sales teams reporting to headquarters, rely on data to make informed decisions and enable systems to run smoothly. Many data functions within operations are automated, such as inventory systems generating replenishment orders or email notifications for unfinished tasks. Ultimately, data is essential for driving efficiency, making informed decisions, and supporting the overall functioning of operations.

STRATEGY

Every organization, whether explicitly stated or not, has a strategy in place. This involves creating a plan to support goals and objectives by identifying challenges and proposing solutions. Strategy can be implemented at different levels within an organization, such as department or division levels, with the goal of understanding the path forward and developing a plan to achieve it. Successful strategy implementation is dependent on operational support to achieve its objectives, with data-driven strategies and operational excellence working hand in hand. The process of creating a strategy involves analyzing the environment, drawing conclusions, and developing a plan guided by principles derived from various factors.

The construction of a plan should not rely solely on data and information but also incorporate the perspectives and beliefs of experienced individuals. The right balance between data and non-data sources is crucial for successful outcomes. Strategy development should be considered an ongoing process, with periodic revisions guided by new data and insights. In the modern era, organizations must be able to quickly adapt to changing environmental conditions, with data playing a key role in their response system.

DECISION MAKING

Without even creating a single unit of raw data, there’s a universe of existing data and information at our fingertips. In addition, increasing numbers of easy-to-use analysis capabilities and tools are democratizing access to insight.

Consumer search engines like Google and Bing have changed how people make decisions, making them more informed. This has impacted the healthcare industry, with patients researching their symptoms and causes. While it has reduced unnecessary clinic visits, incorrect information can be a challenge for doctors. Within organizations, access to data has led to quicker and better decisions, allowing executives to understand their strengths and weaknesses in real-time, rather than waiting until the end of the fiscal quarter.

While there’s little surprise that data-driven decision-making is a fundamental business competency, it all hinges on decision-makers getting access to quality data at the right time. Abundant and out-of-date data are not synonymous with data value. Bad data may be worse than no data. Bad data processed into information and then used as the basis for decisions will result in failure. The outcome of decisions based on bad data could range from a minor mistake to job termination right up to the closing of the business.![image](https://github.com/NdiiLe/Data-Governance-week-2/assets/131252498/cc681758-536d-4de3-82c8-a75640fb3f2c)
