OPERATIONS

Business operations encompass various activities necessary for the daily operation and success of an organization. Different businesses have unique operational needs, with core functions like payroll, order management, and marketing common across most organizations. Some operations, such as IT departments or warehouses, may not be essential for all businesses.
 
Data plays a crucial role in quantifying and optimizing operations, such as in human resources (HR) functions. Various data points are used to make decisions, track progress, and support functions like recruitment and evaluation. Data is generated in abundance throughout these processes, created by applicants, evaluators, and supporting systems. Operations teams, like sales teams reporting to headquarters, rely on data to make informed decisions and enable systems to run smoothly. Many data functions within operations are automated, such as inventory systems generating replenishment orders or email notifications for unfinished tasks. Ultimately, data is essential for driving efficiency, making informed decisions, and supporting the overall functioning of operations.

STRATEGY

Every organization, whether explicitly stated or not, has a strategy in place. This involves creating a plan to support goals and objectives by identifying challenges and proposing solutions. Strategy can be implemented at different levels within an organization, such as department or division levels, with the goal of understanding the path forward and developing a plan to achieve it. Successful strategy implementation is dependent on operational support to achieve its objectives, with data-driven strategies and operational excellence working hand in hand. The process of creating a strategy involves analyzing the environment, drawing conclusions, and developing a plan guided by principles derived from various factors.

The construction of a plan should not rely solely on data and information but also incorporate the perspectives and beliefs of experienced individuals. The right balance between data and non-data sources is crucial for successful outcomes. Strategy development should be considered an ongoing process, with periodic revisions guided by new data and insights. In the modern era, organizations must be able to quickly adapt to changing environmental conditions, with data playing a key role in their response system.

DECISION MAKING

Without even creating a single unit of raw data, there’s a universe of existing data and information at our fingertips. In addition, increasing numbers of easy-to-use analysis capabilities and tools are democratizing access to insight.

Consumer search engines like Google and Bing have changed how people make decisions, making them more informed. This has impacted the healthcare industry, with patients researching their symptoms and causes. While it has reduced unnecessary clinic visits, incorrect information can be a challenge for doctors. Within organizations, access to data has led to quicker and better decisions, allowing executives to understand their strengths and weaknesses in real-time, rather than waiting until the end of the fiscal quarter.

While there’s little surprise that data-driven decision-making is a fundamental business competency, it all hinges on decision-makers getting access to quality data at the right time. Abundant and out-of-date data are not synonymous with data value. Bad data may be worse than no data. Bad data processed into information and then used as the basis for decisions will result in failure. The outcome of decisions based on bad data could range from a minor mistake to job termination right up to the closing of the business.![image](https://github.com/NdiiLe/Data-Governance-week-2/assets/131252498/cc681758-536d-4de3-82c8-a75640fb3f2c)


MEASURING

Organizations constantly measure data to build a business picture. The phrase "what gets measured gets managed" is relevant, although not everything can be easily measured. Leaders need timely information derived from data, emphasizing the importance of measurement in decision-making processes within organizations.

Data measurements can be quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative data is most often described in numerical terms, whereas qualitative data is descriptive and expressed in terms of language.

One way to differentiate between quantitative and qualitative data is by looking at how someone describes a journey in a plane. One person may focus on specific measurements like altitude and speed, while another may focus on subjective experiences like comfort and food quality. Both types of data can be meaningful depending on the audience.

The type of information desired directly correlates to the measurement approach. This is going to inform your choices of at least what, when, where, and how data is captured. A general rule is only to capture and measure what matters. Some may argue that capturing data now to measure later has value even if there isn’t a good case yet. I can buy that but be careful with your limited resources and the potential costs.

William Bruce Cameron's quote suggests that not everything valuable can be measured, and not everything measurable is valuable. It emphasizes the importance of recognizing the limitations of data analysis.

MONITORING

Monitoring is a continuous process of collecting and evaluating the performance of a project, process, or system. Results are compared against existing values or desired targets to ensure expectations are being met. This ongoing monitoring helps ensure continuity, stability, and reliability in various activities and operations.

Involved in monitoring is the data produced by the thing being evaluated. It’s also the data that is produced as a product of monitoring. For example, the deviation from the expected result.

Monitoring involves converting data into insights through reports, real-time systems, and software dashboards. It helps in making decisions by providing information on various aspects like power levels in devices, employee activities, and predictive maintenance. Data measurement and monitoring are interconnected, with data serving as a binding element for business functions. Different teams within an organization handle data measurement, monitoring, and actions based on the data. Data monitoring also involves assessing the quality of data to ensure it is suitable for its intended purpose. This process requires establishing metrics for data quality, such as completeness and accuracy, and continuously evaluating and improving data quality over time. Overall, data monitoring is crucial for effective decision-making and ensuring the reliability of data-driven processes within an organization.

By continuously monitoring the quality of the data in your organization, opportunities and issues may be revealed in a timely manner. Then, if deemed appropriate, actions can be prioritized.

INSIGHT MANAGEMENT

Data forms the building blocks of many business functions. In support of decision-making — arguably its most important value — data is the source for almost all insight. As a basic definition, business insight is sometimes referred to as information that can make a difference.

It’s not enough to simply collect lots of data and expect that insight will suddenly emerge. There must be an attendant management process. Thus, insight management means ensuring that data and information are capable of delivering insight.

Insight management involves analyzing data to determine what information is valuable to an organization. Analysts must understand the organization's information needs and how data flows across different areas. Analytics are then applied to interpret data and draw conclusions. Communication of findings is crucial, with different audiences requiring different methods of delivery. Success is measured by the ability of recipients to make decisions aligned with organizational goals based on the insights provided.

For an insight to be most valuable, it must be the right information, at the right time, in the right format, for the right people. But this in general is no simple task.

REPORTING

Reports play a crucial role in data and information management within organizations. They are essential for creating, delivering, receiving, and acting on important information. The content of a report can vary from summarized to detailed, providing structured data and information. Visual aids, such as charts, are often included to help interpret data more easily. Reports also often include a discussion of findings and may offer recommendations. In today's business environment, data storytelling is becoming increasingly important as a required business skill. Reports are considered the backbone of every organization, highlighting their importance in decision-making processes.

Reports are typically online or physical presentations of data and information on some aspect of an organization. For example, a written and printed report may show all the sales of a particular product or service during a specific period. Sometimes a report is given verbally in person or via a live or recorded video. Whatever the format — and that’s less important today as long as it achieves its objective — a report is developed for a particular audience with a specific purpose.

With so many uses of data and information, the purpose of reporting is largely about improved decision-making. With the right information, in the right format, at the right time, business leaders are empowered to make better decisions, solve problems, and communicate plans and policies.

While reports do empower leaders and give them more tools, they don’t guarantee the right decisions. Knowing something is not the equivalent of making the right choices at the right time.

Other Roles for Data
While we’ve gone over a number of the most visible uses of data in organizations today, it was not the intent to list every conceivable way that data is used. That said, here’s a short list of some other important areas that we should not omit.
• Artificial intelligence (AI):  Data is considered the fuel of AI. It requires a high volume of good data. With huge quantities of quality data, the outcomes of AI improve. It’s from the data that AI learns patterns, identifies relationships, and determines probabilities. In addition, AI is being used to improve the quality and use of data in organizations. 
• Problem-solving:  Acknowledging the close association with decision-making, it’s worth calling out problem-solving as a distinctive use of data. Data plays a role in how a problem is defined, determining what solutions are available, evaluating which solution to use, and measuring the success or failure of the solution that is chosen and applied.
• Data reuse:  While we collect and use data for a specific primary purpose, data is often reused for entirely different reasons. Data that has been collected, used, and stored can be retrieved and used by a different team at another time - assuming they have permission, including access and legal rights (notable controls within data governance). For example, the sales team in an organization will collect your name and address in order to fulfill an order. Later, that same data set may be used by the marketing team to create awareness about other products and services. These are two different teams with different goals using the same data. Data reuse can be considered a positive given that it reduces data collection duplication and increases the value of data to an organization, but it must be managed with care so that it doesn’t break any data use rules. (Note: High-value shared data sets are called master data, and in data governance, they are subject to master data management.)
